## BACKGROUND

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup is in need of a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.  With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Alphabet Soup’s business team provided me with a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.  Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organisation, such as:

EIN and NAME — Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION — Government organisation classification
USE_CASE — Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION — Organisation type
STATUS — Active status
INCOME_AMT — Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively
